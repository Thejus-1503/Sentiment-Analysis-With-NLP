# 💬 Sentiment Analysis using TF-IDF and Logistic Regression

This project implements **Sentiment Analysis** on IMDB movie reviews using classical **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** techniques. The model classifies reviews as either **positive** or **negative**, using a machine learning pipeline built entirely with Python and scikit-learn.

---

## 🎯 Objective

To build a sentiment classifier that can:
- Process and clean raw movie review text
- Convert text data into numerical form using **TF-IDF vectorization**
- Train a **Logistic Regression** model
- Predict sentiment on unseen reviews with high accuracy

## 🛠️ Libraries & Tools

- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn (`TfidfVectorizer`, `LogisticRegression`, `train_test_split`)
